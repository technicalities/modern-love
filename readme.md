## Modern Love: a tool for modelling and visualising orientations

Modern Love will be a tool to visualise the recent explosion in visible sexualities. Before, popularly, there was a simple dichotomy between straight and gay. Now, there are many continuous grades along eight or nine different lines - including not expressing any at all.

This is very exciting for everyone! It doesn't matter if, like me, your apparently honest preferences are actually quite near to the old package deal; we all benefit from the end of unreflective and unfree sex - even if we subsequently remain much the same. Choice dignifies (or, in the [hypothesised absence of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation), insight does).
  
But it is hard to think clearly about these things. I find it helpful to see sex as a high-dimensionality space which suddenly has a half a dozen [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_%28statistics%29). Luckily, things like these can be represented intuitively with graphics. Many people dislike being measured; many more dislike labels. But in my experience, humans like pictures and need words.


#### Features
* A breakdown into seven+ continuous sliders.
* Rotatable 3D graph of any three at once.
* Maybe best to have a comic diagram of stick figures as well. WebGL project \#1.
* Outputs the current academic and tumblr jargon for the triangulation.
* Also demographics, including legal discrimination around the world.
* A string representation of you, a la the [Geek Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Code).
* Option to post your (anonymous!) data for a long-term survey into the diffusion of these ideas.
